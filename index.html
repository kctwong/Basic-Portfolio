                    <p>My name is Travix and I am excited to be joining the UofT coding bootcamp to explore the world of coding and web development.</p>

            <p>I was born in Hong Kong but have been living in Canada since the age of 15. My exposure to coding was limited to some introductory computer science courses in university. I think developing my coding skills would be helpful as it is one of the most on demand skills and also helpful if I want to create my own business one day.  </p>
